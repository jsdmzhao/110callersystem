Debugging (or running) OFBiz in Eclipse

    * Select OFBiz project, right-click on it -> Run As -> Run ... (alike for Debug)
    * Select Java Application and click on New
    * Set Run configuration name to OFBiz
          o Main tab:
                + Project: OFBiz
                + Main class: org.ofbiz.base.start.Start
                + If you need it (to trace a framework bug in the 1st loaded class) you may use the "Stop in Main" Option
          o Arguments:
                + VM arguments: -Xms(minValue)M -Xmx(maxValue)M  (typically minValue = 128, maxValue = 512, more is better of course) -Duser.language=en  
                      # In some case (Suse  SL 10.1 at least) it's better to not define any VM arguments but let the defaults values.
                + Working directory: Use default working directory
          o Classpath
                + Bootstrap Entries: JRE System Library
                + User Entries: ofbiz.jar from OFBiz project
                      # Don't forget to remove the entry "ofbiz (default classpath)" else you may have a message "Can't find bundle for base name cache, locale ..."
          o Source tab
                + Click Add Projects... (buttons on the right)
                + Select the ofbiz project
          o Environment
                + Add environment variable LC_ALL=C (Optional, Linux only)
    * Click on Apply and Run (or Debug)

Note that when doing development work, you will have to stop OFBiz, run an Ant build and re-start. Because this method treats OFBiz as a plain Java up, you don't have any automatic classloading as you might be used to when using Eclipse-WTP and developing webapps.
